# mlex_image_classification
Image classifiers with an assortment of neural networks using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). These image classifiers can be deployed through [MLCoach](https://github.com/mlexchange/mlex_mlcoach).

## Neural Networks
The following networks are available for image classification in this package:
- [xception](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/xception/Xception)
- [vgg16](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/vgg16/VGG16)
- [vgg19](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/vgg19/VGG19)
- [resnet101](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/ResNet101)

## Data Ingestion
Datasets can be retrieved from filesystem and [Tiled](https://blueskyproject.io/tiled/).

## Labels
Labels are managed by [Splash-ml](https://github.com/als-computing/splash-ml)
